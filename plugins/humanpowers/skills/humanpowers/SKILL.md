name: humanpowers
description: Single entry point for humanpowers. Detects cwd context (in-repo or external), creates .humanpowers/ workspace skeleton when absent, then routes by phase. Developer types `$humanpowers` (optionally with a subcommand) and the dispatcher determines the next skill. Use whenever the developer wants to start or resume design-first work.

# humanpowers Dispatcher

## Behavior

Single entry to humanpowers. Two responsibilities:

1. **Workspace structure** — locate or create `.humanpowers/` and seed `state.json`.
2. **Phase routing** — read `state.json` and hand off to the next skill.

The dispatcher does not author content. The skill chain is brainstorm -> writing-plans -> quiz -> operate -> verification -> review -> finish. brainstorming owns `problem.md`; writing-plans owns `tasks.md` + `tasks/{id}/plan.md`; quiz owns `tasks/{id}/round1.md`; operate / verification / review own per-task lifecycle.

## Step 1: Locate workspace

```bash
eval "$(bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/find-workspace.sh" 2>/dev/null)"
```

If `WS` is non-empty -> existing workspace, jump to Step 3.

If `WS` is empty (script exits 1) -> no workspace, go to Step 2.

## Step 2: Create workspace skeleton

```bash
eval "$(bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/init-workspace.sh")"
# Sets: WS_DIR, KIND, TARGET
```

Output to user:

```
Workspace created: <WS_DIR>
workspace_kind: <KIND>
target_repo: <TARGET>

Note: this workspace is local-only. The repo's .gitignore excludes .humanpowers/ entirely.
The decision artifact is created at the finish phase as docs/decisions/<slug>.md and committed.

Invoking humanpowers:brainstorming to define the problem.
```

Hand off to `humanpowers:brainstorming`.

## Step 3: Existing workspace — validate + route

Validate schema with `scripts/check-state.sh "$WS"`. If exit code 1, propagate the error message verbatim and stop.

Read phase:

```bash
PHASE=$(jq -r .phase "$WS/.humanpowers/state.json")
```

Route:

| phase | Next skill |
|-------|-----------|
| `""` (empty) | humanpowers:brainstorming |
| `problem-defined` | humanpowers:writing-plans |
| `designed` | humanpowers:quiz |
| `quiz-done` | humanpowers:operate (per remaining task; supports `--batch`) |
| `built` | humanpowers:verification-before-completion |
| `verified` (some tasks) | humanpowers:review or humanpowers:operate (next task) |
| `verified` (all tasks) | humanpowers:finishing-a-development-branch |

Echo current state before routing:

```
Workspace: <WS>
Phase: <PHASE>
Tasks: <verified>/<total> verified, <built>/<total> built, <quiz_done>/<total> quiz-done
```

If a subcommand was passed, apply the override after the echo.

## Step 4: Subcommands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `$humanpowers continue` | resume current phase (default behavior) |
| `$humanpowers jump <phase>` | force jump to phase; warn if skipping a gate |
| `$humanpowers operate <task-id>` | invoke humanpowers:operate with a specific task |
| `$humanpowers operate --batch` | invoke humanpowers:operate over all remaining unbuilt tasks |
| `$humanpowers review` | invoke humanpowers:review for cross-task cascade |
| `$humanpowers abort` | mark workspace aborted in state.json + stop |

`abort` sets `phase = "aborted"` via `scripts/update-state.sh "$WS" phase aborted`.

## Notes for skill authors

Skills downstream of the dispatcher must:

- Read workspace location via upward search from cwd (same logic as Step 1). Do not hard-code a fixed home-relative path.
- Read `target_repo` from `state.json` when they need the code repo (operate, verification, finishing).
- Update phase via `scripts/update-state.sh` rather than manual jq edits.

### Handoff protocol

Every skill that transitions to another phase MUST follow this 3-step protocol at its terminal state. No exceptions.

```
1. UPDATE  — bash scripts/update-state.sh "$WS" phase <new-phase>
2. REPORT  — one line: "Phase -> <new-phase>. Invoking humanpowers:<next-skill>."
3. INVOKE  — invoke the next skill immediately.
             Do NOT summarize and wait. Do NOT ask "what next?".
```

**Exception — developer gate:** If the next phase requires developer action before starting (e.g., developer must edit round1.md), the skill states what's needed, confirms readiness with the developer, THEN invokes. The skill still invokes — it does not leave the developer to remember which skill comes next.

**Canonical handoff chain:**

| From | Phase set | Invoke |
|------|-----------|--------|
| brainstorming | `problem-defined` | `humanpowers:writing-plans` |
| writing-plans | `designed` | `humanpowers:quiz` |
| quiz | `quiz-done` | `humanpowers:operate` (or `--batch`) |
| operate (single) | task status -> `built` | `humanpowers:verification-before-completion` for that task |
| operate (batch) | phase -> `built` | `humanpowers:verification-before-completion` for first unverified task |
| verification | task status -> `verified` | `humanpowers:operate` (next task) or `humanpowers:review` (all verified) |
| review | phase -> `reviewed` | `humanpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` |
| finishing | phase -> `finished` | `humanpowers:retrospective` (offer, not force) |

"Hand off" in any skill document means "execute the 3-step protocol." It does not mean "tell the developer about the next skill."
