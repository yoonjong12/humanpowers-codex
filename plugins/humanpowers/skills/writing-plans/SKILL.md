# Writing Plans

## Overview

Writing-plans is the design step in the humanpowers loop (brainstorm -> writing-plans -> quiz -> operate). It reads `problem.md` (produced by `humanpowers:brainstorming`) and produces:

1. `tasks.md` — full per-task design with stable item IDs that the quiz cites.
2. `tasks/{id}/plan.md` — implementation plan per task, broken into bite-sized TDD steps.

The plan assumes the engineer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, the actual code, expected test output, exact commands. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to expand the task outline."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by `humanpowers:using-git-worktrees`).

## Inputs

- `<workspace>/.humanpowers/problem.md` — read criteria, invariants, out-of-scope, open questions, preliminary task outline.
- `<workspace>/.humanpowers/state.json` — phase should be `problem-defined`. If not, halt and ask the developer to confirm `problem.md` is signed off.
- `~/.humanpowers/learnings/writing-plans.md` — if exists, read as medium-trust context for task decomposition and dependency ordering.

## Outputs

- `<workspace>/.humanpowers/tasks.md` — one section per task, with full item IDs. Use template at `references/templates/tasks.md`.
- `<workspace>/.humanpowers/tasks/{id}/plan.md` — TDD steps per task.

## Item ID enforcement

Each task in `tasks.md` carries top-level metadata (`WHO`, `WHY`, `ACTION_TYPE`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `STATUS`) plus five categories of cited items, each with stable IDs. The quiz cites these IDs; downstream artifacts (plan.md, verify.md, ADR digest) trace decisions to them. IDs are append-only.

| Category | ID format | What goes here |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Observables | `task-N.observable-N` | What an outside reader sees once the task is done — file path, API shape, DB column, UI element. |
| Verify conditions | `task-N.verify-condition-N` | Concrete pass criterion — curl response shape, SQL row count, Gherkin scenario, checklist item. |
| Constraints | `task-N.constraint-N` | Task-local quantitative bound (latency, cap, count), qualitative invariant, prohibition. |
| Assumptions | `task-N.assumption-N` | Input shape, prior data state, environment configuration, upstream behavior taken as given. |
| Dependencies | `task-N.dependency-N` | Inputs and preconditions sourced from elsewhere — another task's output, an external service, a config value. |

Do NOT skip any of the five categories. If a category is empty for a task, write `(none for this task)` rather than omitting the section — empty is a legitimate signal, omission is not.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure — but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

## Bite-Sized Step Granularity (per-task plan.md)

Each step in `plan.md` is one action (2-5 minutes):
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

```

## Test design (per-task plan.md)

Before writing TDD steps, check existing tests for the module being modified:

```bash
grep -r "def test_.*{function_name}" tests/
```

See `references/test-architecture-guidelines.md` for the full rules. Key points for plan authoring:
- One behavior = one test = one owner file. Don't create parallel test files for the same module.
- If an existing test already covers the behavior, extend it (parametrize or add case) instead of writing a duplicate.
- Plan steps that say "Write the failing test" must specify which test file the test goes in and why (new behavior vs extending existing).

## Step structure (plan.md)

````markdown
- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Build Order from depends_on

Read `tasks.md`. Compute topological order from `DEPENDS_ON`:

1. Tasks with `DEPENDS_ON: []` -> can start immediately, parallel-eligible.
2. Tasks with deps -> wait until all deps `STATUS: verified`.
3. Cycle in deps = abort, ask developer to break cycle.

Use `humanpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` for parallel-eligible tasks during operate.

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content the engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Self-Review

After writing `tasks.md` and all `tasks/{id}/plan.md` files, look at them with fresh eyes.

When cross-checking specific criteria or invariants, fetch only what you need:
```bash
bash scripts/get-invariant.sh criterion-N "$WS"
bash scripts/get-invariant.sh invariant-N "$WS"
```

1. **problem.md coverage:** Does each `criterion-N` map to at least one task's observable or verify-condition? Does each `invariant-N` apply to at least one task's constraint? List gaps.
2. **Item ID hygiene:** Does every `task-N` have all five categories present (even if empty)? Are IDs sequential and unique?
3. **Placeholder scan:** Search for the patterns above. Fix them.
4. **Type consistency:** Do types, signatures, and property names used in later tasks match those defined in earlier tasks? `clearLayers()` in task-3 but `clearFullLayers()` in task-7 is a bug.
5. **TDD discipline:** Does every plan.md step alternate failing-test -> implementation -> passing-test -> commit?
6. **Test placement:** Does every "write test" step specify the owner file? Are there parallel test files for the same module? See `references/test-architecture-guidelines.md`.
7. **Convention coverage:** For each file in "Files touched," check project rules (CLAUDE.md, `~/.claude/rules/*.md`) and established codebase patterns (decorators, span naming, error style, import conventions). If a convention applies but no task constraint or observable captures it, append the item ID now.

Fix issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

## Phase transition

After tasks.md and all plan.md files are written and self-reviewed, set the phase:

```bash
WS="$(dirname "$(find . -maxdepth 3 -name state.json -path '*/.humanpowers/*' | head -1)")"
WS="$(dirname "$WS")"
bash scripts/update-state.sh "$WS" phase designed
bash scripts/update-state.sh "$WS" tasks_total <count>
```

## Handoff to quiz (follow handoff protocol)

Terminal state of writing-plans. Execute the 3-step handoff protocol (see humanpowers dispatcher, Notes for skill authors):

1. Phase already set to `designed` in Phase transition above.
2. Report: "Phase -> designed. Invoking humanpowers:quiz."
3. Invoke `humanpowers:quiz` immediately.

The quiz reads `tasks.md` and produces a 9-row x N-column matrix per task in `tasks/{id}/round1.md`. Operate runs only after quizzes are locked.

## Loop kick-back

If the quiz reveals a missing item or a contradiction, return here:

- **Missing observable / verify-condition / constraint / assumption / dependency** -> append a new ID to `tasks.md`. The quiz re-cites.
- **Task split needed** -> add a new `task-N`, update `DEPENDS_ON` of dependent tasks, re-derive `plan.md` for affected tasks.
- **Plan step contradicts a locked round1.md answer** -> revise `plan.md` for that task. The locked round1.md takes precedence.

If the gap is at the problem level (criterion / invariant / out-of-scope / open-question), the kick-back goes to `humanpowers:brainstorming` instead. Writing-plans does not author `problem.md` items.

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in every step — if a step changes code, show the code
- Exact commands with expected output
- Item IDs are append-only; never reuse a removed ID
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
