# Tasks

> Output of `humanpowers:writing-plans` (preliminary outline comes from `humanpowers:brainstorming` task outline). One section per task. Items inside each task carry stable IDs (`task-N.observable-N`, `task-N.verify-condition-N`, `task-N.constraint-N`, `task-N.assumption-N`, `task-N.dependency-N`) so the quiz can cite them and downstream artifacts (plan, verify, ADR digest) can trace decisions to specific items.

## task-1: <short descriptive name>

**WHO**: <persona — the user role this task serves>
**WHY**: <value hypothesis — one line>
**ACTION_TYPE**: ui | api | data | infra | cross-cutting
**DEPENDS_ON**: []  # list of task IDs (e.g., [task-2, task-3]) that must be `verified` before this one starts
**STATUS**: brainstorm-done | quiz-done | designed | built | verified

### Observables (`task-1.observable-N`)

What observable changes does this task introduce? File paths, API shapes, DB columns, UI elements — anything an outside reader can see without reading the implementation.

- task-1.observable-1: <observable change>
- task-1.observable-2: <observable change>

### Verify conditions (`task-1.verify-condition-N`)

Concrete pass criteria. Each condition must be checkable: a curl response shape, a SQL row count, a Gherkin scenario, a checklist item.

- task-1.verify-condition-1: <test or demo condition>

### Constraints (`task-1.constraint-N`)

Task-local non-functional requirements. Quantitative bounds (latency, size cap, count cap), qualitative invariants (no PII in logs), prohibitions.

- task-1.constraint-1: <bound or prohibition>

### Assumptions (`task-1.assumption-N`)

Verified preconditions the task builds on. Each assumption must have been confirmed with evidence (query result, code read, doc reference) before writing it here. An unverified guess is NOT an assumption — it belongs in `problem.md` as `open-question-N` until proven.

- task-1.assumption-1: <precondition> — **evidence**: <what confirmed this>

### Dependencies (`task-1.dependency-N`)

Inputs and preconditions sourced from elsewhere — another task's output, an external service, a config value, a library version. Distinct from `DEPENDS_ON` (which is a task-graph edge); this lists the actual artifacts the task consumes.

- task-1.dependency-1: <input source>

## task-2: <short descriptive name>

(Same structure. Repeat per task.)
